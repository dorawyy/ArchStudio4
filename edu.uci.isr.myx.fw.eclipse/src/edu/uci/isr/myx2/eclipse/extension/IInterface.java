/**
 * (Brick)Interface.
 * An interface is a port through which bricks exchanges their service objects.
 * An interface has the following attributes.
 * <ul>
 *  <li>id : the unique id of the interface</li>
 * 	<li>name : the name of the interface</li>
 * 	<li>direction : the direction of the interface 
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>Direction.IN : the brick is used by others through this interface.</li>
 * 		<li>Direction.OUT_SINGLE: the brick uses only one brick through this interface.</li>
 * 		<li>Direction.OUT_MULTI: the brick uses more than one brick through this interface.</li>
 * 		</ul>
 *  </li>
 * 	<li>connectionTiming : the connection timing of the interface
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li> ConnectionTiming.NONE : the initializing timing is not cared.</li>
 * 		<li> ConnectionTiming.CONNECT_BEFORE_INIT : the brick will be connected to others 
 * 								before its initialization.</li>
 * 		<li> ConnectionTiming.CONNECT_BEFORE_BEGIN : the brick must be initialized first, 
 * 								then it will be connected to others.</li>
 * 		</ul>
 *  </li>
 * 	<li>javaInterface : the fully qualified Java Interface Name assigned to the interface. 
 * 			This java interface must exist before source code generation is called.</li>
 * 	<li>templateType : the template type how the interface should be implemented.
 * 		MyxCodegen generates code according to the template type.
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>NONE: no source code generation.</li>
 * 		<li> DELEGATE: The java interface of this signature will be (or has been)
 * 			imlemented outside of the brick class, and the brick will delegate to it.
 * 			A variable will be used to store the connection(s).</li>
 * 		<li> DELEGATE_WITH_GETTERS_AND_SETTERS: The java interface of this signature will be
 * 			(or has been) imlemented outside of the brick class, and the brick will
 * 			delegate it. Getters and Setters will be used to retrieve the connection(s).</li>
 * 		<li>IMPLEMENTED_IN_BRICK: (This option is only for inServiceObject) The java interface of this signature will be implemented
 * 			in the brick class.</li>
 * 		<li> IMPLEMENTED_IN_DELEGATE:(This option is only for outMultipleServiceObjects
 * 			direction.) The java interface of this signature will be implemented in a
 * 			proxy class that delegates the method calling to all the service objects. A
 * 			variable will be used to store the connection(s).</li>
 *		<li>IMPLEMENTED_IN_DELEGATE_WITH_GETTERS_AND_SETTERS:(This option is only for
 * 			outMultipleServiceObjects direction.) The java interface of this signature
 * 			will be implemented in a proxy class that delegates the method calling to all
 * 			the service objects. Getters and Setters will be used to retrieve the
 * 			connection(s).</li>
 * 		</ul>
 *  </li>
