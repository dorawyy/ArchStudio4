<h1>Apigen</h1>

<p>If you've used the <a href="./tools-dbl.html">xArch/xADL 2.0 Data Binding Library</a>,
you'll notice that many of the files are authored by "Apigen."  Apigen
is an XML schema-to-Java data binding generator
<i>for xArch schemas</i> that automatically
generates those libraries based only on the XML schemas.  It supports
a large subset of the XML schema language.

<p>Apigen is still in an Alpha state, and full documentation on using the
tool is not yet available.  However, we have evolved it to the point
of release.  If you are involved in developing your own
xArch/xADL 2.0 extension schemas, feel free to try them with apigen.
However, please also contact <a href="mailto:edashofy@ics.uci.edu">Eric
Dashofy</a> for assistance.

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note!</b></font> Previous versions of this product
used Apache Xerces as the underlying XML parser.  The latest version of the
library has been converted to use the Sun Crimson parser included with
J2SDK 1.4.  As such, the product must be executed and run with J2SDK1.4.

<p>You can download J2SDK1.4
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">here</a>
if you do not already have it.
