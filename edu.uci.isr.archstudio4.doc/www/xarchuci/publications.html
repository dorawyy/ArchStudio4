<p><i><b>Abstract</b></i>
<br>Research and experimentation in software architectures over the
past decade have yielded a plethora of software architecture description
languages (ADLs). Continuing innovation indicates that
it is reasonable to expect more new ADLs, or at least ADL features.
This research process is impeded by the difficulty and cost
associated with developing new notations. An architect in need of
a unique set of modeling features must either develop a new architecture
description language from scratch or undertake the daunting
task of modifying an existing language. In either case, it is
unavoidable that a significant effort will be expended in building
or adapting tools to support the language. To remedy this situation,
we have developed an infrastructure for the rapid development
of new architecture description languages. Key aspects of
the infrastructure are its XML-based modular extension mechanism,
its base set of reusable and customizable architectural modeling
constructs, and its equally important set of flexible support
tools. This paper introduces the infrastructure and demonstrates
its value in the context of several real-world applications.

<p><i><b>Abstract</b></i>
<p>Software architecture research focuses on models of software
architectures as specified in architecture description
languages (ADLs). As research progresses in specific areas of
software architectures, more and more architectural
information is created. Ideally, this information can be stored
in the model. An extensible modeling language is crucial to
experimenting with and building tools for novel modeling
constructs that arise from evolving research. Traditional
ADLs typically support a small set of modeling constructs
very well, but adapt to others poorly. XML provides an ideal
platform upon which to develop an extensible modeling
language for software architectures. Previous XML-based
ADLs successfully leveraged XML’s large base of off-the-shelf
tool support, but did not take advantage of its extensibility. To
give software architecture researchers more freedom to
explore new possibilities and modeling techniques while
maximizing reuse of tools and modeling constructs, we have
developed xADL 2.0, a highly extensible XML-based ADL.
xADL 2.0 supports run-time and design time modeling,
architecture configuration management, and model-based
system instantiation. Additionally, xADL 2.0 has a set of
extensible infrastructure tools that support the creation,
manipulation, and sharing of xADL 2.0 documents.

<h2>Issues in Generating Data Bindings for an XML Schema-Based Language</h2>

<p><i><b>Abstract</b></i>
<p>XML’s meta-language aspect and extensive tool support make it an
attractive way to build modularly extensible modeling languages.
XML’s original meta-language, the document type definition
(DTD), is being replaced by the more expressive XML schema.
Developing programmatic tools to manipulate models specified in
XML schemas is made easier though the use of data bindings. Data bindings
model elements and attributes in XML schemas as objects
in an object-oriented programming language. We have developed
an XML-schema aware generator for Java data bindings called <i>'apigen'</i>.
While developing apigen, we encountered and worked
through several issues, both essential and accidental, related to generating
XML schema data bindings. These issues, and the solutions
we developed, are described in this paper.

<h2>Representing Product Family Architectures in an Extensible Architecture Description Language</h2>

<br>In <i>Proceedings of the International Workshop on Product Family Engineering (PFE-4)</i>, Bilbao, Spain, October 2001.

<p><i><b>Abstract</b></i>
<p>Product family architectures need to be captured much like "regular" software architectures.
Unfortunately, representations for product family architectures are scarce and a deep understanding
of all of the necessary features of such representations is still lacking. In this paper,
we introduce an extensible XML-based representation that is suitable as a basis for rapidly
defining new representations for product family architectures. We describe some of the details
of this representation and present how Koala and Mae, two early representations for product family
architectures, can be mapped onto our XML-based representation with relatively little effort.
