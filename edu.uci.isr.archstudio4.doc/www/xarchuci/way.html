<h1>The xADL 2.0 Way</h1>

<p>The past ten to fifteen years of software and systems architecture
research have created a huge number of (largely incompatible)
architecture description languages - notations for writing
down architectures.  It is easy to get entranced with the idea
that the best concepts from all these languages could be combined
into a single "super ADL" that was adequate for all domains and
projects.

<p>However, architecture is a broad concept, and each project/domain's
notion of what an architecture is and what sorts of data it should
contain is different (and rightly so!)  Furthermore, the purpose of an architecture
description is largely driven by project stakeholders and their needs.
Thus, <i>no one ADL will ever fit all projects or domains</i>.

<p>xADL 2.0's strength is <b>not</b> that it includes modeling features
suitable for every potential project.  In fact; where methodologies
disagree or diverge, xADL 2.0 tends to take a neutral approach,
not advocating or encoding one set of concepts over another.
xADL 2.0's primary strength is its <i>extensibility</i>&mdash;it
can <b>act as the basis for the rapid development of
domain/project-specific ADLs</b>.

<h2>Using xADL 2.0 in Your Project</h2>

<p>Using xADL 2.0 in a project means integrating it into a development
process.  Because of the diversity of projects and needs, it's
unlikely that xADL 2.0 (or any other ADL or notation) will support
all your needs right off the bat (although, as xADL 2.0 and its
tool support grows, this may change).

<p>Unlike other notations, xADL 2.0's syntax and tools were <i>meant</i>
to be extended to support project-specific needs.  The process by
which this is done is roughly as follows:

<ol>
<li>Identify discrepancies between what xADL 2.0 can model
    in its set of provided schemas and what you want to model
    for your project.
<li>Decide which xADL 2.0 elements to extend to support your
    new modeling needs&mdash;do you need to add new kinds
    of data to structural elements like components and connectors?
    Their types? Or do you need new kinds of elements altogether?
<li>Decide how to syntactically encode these new extensions
    or elements.
<li>Write new XML schemas extending xADL 2.0 to add your new
    modeling constructs.  Validate your new schemas with
    a tool like
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">XSV</a>.
<li>Run <a href="tools-apigen.html">Apigen</a> to generate a new data
    binding library that includes your extensions.
<li>Use syntax-based tools like
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">ArchStudio 3's</a>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/archedit.html">ArchEdit</a>
    to extend existing architecture descriptions with
    new kinds of data in the format you specified.
<li>Extend semantics based tools like ArchStudio 3's Archipelago
    and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/tron.html">Tron</a>
    to provide friendlier editors and analysis tools for your new
    notational extensions.
</ol>

<p>The xADL 2.0 language itself is built and evolved in precisely
this way.  For example, the product-line schemas (<code>options.xsd</code>,
<code>variants.xsd</code>, and <code>versions.xsd</code>)
and the implementation schemas (<code>implementation.xsd</code> and
<code>javaimplementation.xsd</code>) are simply extensions of the Structure & Types
schema (<code>types.xsd</code>).  Over time, ArchStudio 3's tool
sets have evolved to better support these extensions, and many
ArchStudio 3 tools (like Archipelago and Tron) are built in very modular ways
to make extending them to support new schemas as easy as possible.

<h2>Why not arbitrary name-value pair properties?</h2>

<p>We get this question often enough that it warrants having
a section on this page.  Many xADL 2.0 users find the
above extension process somewhat cumbersome and ask for
extensions that decorate some (or all) xADL 2.0 elements
with arbitrary name-value pair properties (or, alternatively,
name-type-value tuples).

<p>While this would indeed make it
relatively easy to slip new data into an architecture description,
we've repeatedly rejected this suggestion for a number of reasons.
Allowing arbitrary properties means forfeiting
the rigor provided by having a well-defined language syntax.
xADL 2.0's syntax is designed to be rigorous but not formal.
Losing this rigor means:

<ul>
<li><b>(Uncontrolled) Language Fragmentation:</b> Allowing
    any user to insert arbitrary data into xADL 2.0
    documents means that each user will potentially have their
    own 'xADL 2.0 dialect' that is undocumented and will likely
    be incompatible (in subtle ways) with others' xADL 2.0
    dialects.
<li><b>Inability to validate properties:</b> XML schema-based
    validators can check xADL 2.0 documents for syntactic
    correctness, but only if schemas are present.  Properties
    allow users to subvert even simple syntax validators.
<li><b>Loss of syntax-directed tools</b>: Apigen and ArchEdit
    are powerful examples of how syntax-directed tools can
    add value to an architecture-driven development environment.
    However, these tools can provide little or no additional
    value and guidance if all they know is that an element
    has properties with charcter string names and values.
<li><b>Encourages encodings-within-encodings and overloading</b>:
    The presence of arbitrary properties makes it very tempting
    to add structured data as character string property values;
    a job that is much better handled by encoding that structured
    data in XML elements and attributes.  Already we see this
    problem occurring with xADL 2.0's descriptive elements like
    Descriptions, which have been variously overloaded to have
    additional semantics beyond their intended use.  This
    invariably leads to fragility in tools and document
    portability and maintenance problems.
</ul>

<p>Of course, in keeping with the xADL 2.0 notion that no one
set of concepts fits all, it is still perfectly legal to extend
xADL 2.0 with your own property-based extensions and tools if
you like.  However, for the reasons outlined above, we strongly
advocate a more careful examination of your modeling needs to
decide (and codify) exactly what new data you're interested
in adding to your architecture descriptions.
