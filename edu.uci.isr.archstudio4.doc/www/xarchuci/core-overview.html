<h1>xArch Core Overview</h1>

<p>The core of xArch is the instance schema, which was jointly developed by
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uci.edu/">the University of California, Irvine</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
The core specification can be extended to add new features or increase its
expressiveness.  For examples of extensions to the core, see our
<a href="ext-overview.html">extensions page</a>.

<p>The primary source of information about the core schema is available at the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/xarch/">official xArch
site</a>.  However, we are mirroring it below for convenience, and we are also
providing some additional documentation/diagrams.

<br>Depends on: None

<p>The instance specification provides xArch:
<ul>
<li><b>Architectural Instances</b>: The ability to model the run-time
structure of a system in terms of its connector, component, interface,
and link instances.  The core does not specify any semantic constraints
on these entities.
<li><b>General Groups</b>: A grouping mechanism to group instance elements
in arbitrary ways; for instance: by author, by machine (in a distributed
environment), by language, etc.
<li><b>Sub-architectures</b>: The ability to specify a component or
connector instance that has an internal architecture, also specified
in xArch.
</ul>
