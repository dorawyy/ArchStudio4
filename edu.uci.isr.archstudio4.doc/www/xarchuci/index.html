<h1>Welcome to the xADL 2.0 Homepage!</h1>

<p>Welcome to the xADL 2.0 homepage!  xADL 2.0 is an
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/">architecture</a>
description language (ADL) for software and systems developed by the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a>
at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a>.

<p>This is where you can find all of UCI's latest
enhancements and tools for the xADL 2.0 software and systems
architecture description language (see below for description).

<p>If you're a software or systems engineer visiting this site
for the first time, you've probably got your own ideas about
architecture description notations.  We've added a page covering
how xADL 2.0 is different from other ADLs and how to use it in your
own projects called <a href="way.html">"The xADL 2.0 Way"</a>.

<p><b>The xADL 2.0 language itself is not bound
to any particular architectural style, tool set, or methodology</b>.
xADL 2.0 and tools such as
<a href="tools-apigen.html">Apigen</a> and the
<a href="tools-dbl.html">xArch/xADL 2.0 Data Binding Library</a> can be
used by themselves, independent of any particular development
environment or domain.  However, we have integrated many
more advanced xADL 2.0 tools in the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">ArchStudio 3
Architecture-centric Development Environment</a>.  Most users
interested in working with xADL 2.0 will want to download and use
ArchStudio 3 as well as the basic xADL 2.0 tools.

<h1>Latest Updates:</h1>

<p><img src="images/updated.gif" alt="Updated!"> <i>[January 4, 2005]</i> -
Apigen (and the data binding library) have been updated to better encapsulate
the implementation of data bindings.  Document-level operations
(create, clone, parse, serialize, create contexts) are now done through
an object that implements the <code>IXArchImplementation</code> interface.
The DOM-based (default) implementation of this object is accessible
by calling <code>XArchUtils.getDefaultXArchImplementation()</code>.
The corresponding functions in XArchUtils (for creating, cloning, parsing,
etc.) have been deprecated.  The <a href="Test.java"><code>Test.java</code></a>
example code has been updated to reflect these changes.

<p><img src="images/new.gif" alt="New!"> <i>[November 12, 2002]</i> -
<a target="_blank" href="./javadoc/xarchlibs/">xArch/xADL 2.0 Data Binding
Library Javadoc</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="./javadoc/apigen/">Apigen Javadoc</a> now
online!

<p><img src="images/updated.gif" alt="Updated!"> <i>[March 28, 2002]</i> -
Made updates to the versions schema; see the schema changelog for details.
Released new Data Binding Library to match.  Also, updated this site to
eliminate the use of frames, so it's now easier to directly link to a page
within the site.

<p>Here, you will find xADL 2.0 schemas, developed by UCI,
that extend the core (instance) xArch language, as well
as tools UCI has developed for working with xADL 2.0 documents.

<h1>What is xADL 2.0?</h1>
<p>xADL 2.0 is a software architecture description language (ADL)
developed by the University of California, Irvine for modeling
the architecture of software systems.  Unlike many other ADLs,
xADL 2.0 is defined as a set of
<a target="_blank" "http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML schemas</a>.
This gives xADL 2.0 unprecedented extensibility and flexibility,
as well as basic support from the many available commercial XML
tools.

<p>The current set of xADL 2.0 schemas includes modeling support for:

<ul>
<li>run-time and design-time elements of a system;
<li>support for architectural types;
<li>advanced configuration management concepts such as versions,
options, and variants;
<li>product family architectures; and
<li>architecture "diff"ing (initial support).
</ul>

<p>We plan to extend this set as our research interests evolve.  Users
of xADL are free to choose elements from this set or create their
own extensions as needed.

<p>xADL 2.0 is also an application of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarch/">xArch</a>,
a core XML schema defined
jointly by UCI and Carnegie Mellon University.  More information
about xArch can be found in the next section.

<h1>What is xArch?</h1>
<p><i>From the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarch/">main xArch webpage</a>:</i>
<p>xArch is a standard, extensible XML-based representation
for software architectures. xArch provides a common core
XML notation for architectures that can serve:
<ul>
<li>as a simple stand-alone representation for architectures. Specifically, xArch provides a common
set of bare-bones features that can be used to model an architecture.
<li>as a starting point for other, more advanced XML-based architectural notations.
Specifically, the common core can be reused while support for other, more
advanced ADLs (e.g., Acme, C2SADEL, Rapide) can be added through the
creation of XML namespace extensions.
<li>as an interchange mechanism for architectural descriptions. Specifically,
translators can be built to and from the XML notation.
</ul>
