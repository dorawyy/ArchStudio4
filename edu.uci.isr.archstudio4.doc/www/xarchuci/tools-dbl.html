<h1>xArch/xADL 2.0 Data Binding Library</h1>

<p>We are extremely proud to release initial versions of the xArch/xADL 2.0
Data Binding Library for creating, parsing, manipulating, and writing xArch and
xADL 2.0 documents.
These libraries provide a convenient, xArch/xADL 2.0-oriented Java interface to
xArch documents.  Libraries currently available support the instance (core)
xArch specification, as well as all the extensions on our
<a href="ext-overview.html">extensions page</a>.  These libraries
are available for immediate download.

<p>For an example of how to use these libraries, click
<a target="_blank" href="Test.java">here</a>.

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Note!</b></font> Previous versions of this library
used Apache Xerces as the underlying XML parser.  The latest version of the
library has been converted to use the Sun Crimson parser included with
J2SDK 1.4.  As such, the library must be executed and run with J2SDK1.4.

<p>You can download J2SDK1.4
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">here</a>
if you do not already have it.

<p><img src="images/updated.gif" alt="Updated!"> <i>[September 27, 2001]</i> -
We now have a small example file available, in Java, that demonstrates how to use
the DOM-based xArch libraries.  It's available
<a target="_blank" href="Test.java">here</a>.
