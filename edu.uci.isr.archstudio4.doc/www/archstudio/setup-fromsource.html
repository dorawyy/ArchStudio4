<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document describes how to check out the ArchStudio 4 (and constituent)
   code from <a href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio4">GitHub</a> and build ArchStudio from source.</p>

<p>Casual ArchStudio users or those evaluating the technology should probably
   just <a href="setup-easy.html">download and install the latest pre-built release</a>.
   However, ArchStudio developers - those who are interested in developing
   new ArchStudio components, making changes to ArchStudio itself, or those
   interested in having bleeding-edge updates to ArchStudio before they go into
   official release - should check out the ArchStudio source code and build
   the environment from source.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Source Code Environment</h1>

<p>ArchStudio and related projects are stored and managed in a
   <a href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio4">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<p>ArchStudio is built in and for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
   development environment.  Although you can check out ArchStudio source code
   without using Eclipse, we recommend doing it in Eclipse so you can actually
   build the source.</p>

<p>If you are just interested in browsing the source without checking it out,
   you can <a href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio4">browse the raw source
   archive</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>What You'll Need</h1>

<p>You will need the following installed on your machine:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>(Required)</b> A Java 2 SE, version 5.0 Software Development Kit;</li>
  <li><b>(Required)</b> Eclipse 4.2 or better <b>(Classic version)</b>; and</li>
  <li><b>(Required)</b> ArchStudio itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Java 2 Software Development Kit</h2>

<p>At the current time, ArchStudio is developed on Java 2 Standard
   Edition, version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0).  You can download the runtime environment
   or development toolkit from:</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a></p>

<h2>Eclipse 4.2 or Better</h2>

<p>You will also need to download Eclipse 4.2 or better, and install it
   on your machine. Downloads and installation instructions
   are available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org/</a>.
   If you already have Eclipse, you can also download and extract a second
   copy in a separate directory solely for ArchStudio if you so desire.</p>

<h2>ArchStudio Itself</h2>

<p>You will also need to install ArchStudio itself in order to build ArchStudio. Follow the <a href="setup-easy.html"/>instructions to install ArchStudio</a> and install it
   into your Eclipse environment.

<h1>Checking Out Source Code</h1>

<p>Once you have the tools above installed and running, you can
	check out the ArchStudio source code. ArchStudio is composed of a
	number of different plug-ins, each of which contributes a part to
	the environment.</p>

<p>To check out the code perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to the Git perspective by going to Window | Perspective | Open
		Perspective | Other... | Select "Git" | Hit OK.</li>
	<li>Select "Clone a Git Repository".</li>
	<li>In the Source Git Repository dialog box that pops up, 
		enter the following for the URI field: 
		<a target="_blank"
				href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio4.git">
						https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio4.git</a>.</li>
	<li>Click Next to go to Branch Selection page.</li>
	<li>Ensure that "master" is selected.</li>
	<li>Click Next again to go to the Local Destination page.</li>
	<li>Select "Import all existing projects after clone finishes".</li>
	<li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>The checkout may take several minutes. After it is completed, you will
	want to return to the Plug-in perspective. To do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to the Plug-in perspective by going to Window | Perspective | 
		Open Perspective | Other... | Select "Plug-in Development" | 
		Hit OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>After completing the steps above, you should have the Eclipse
	environment populated with the many plug-ins used to develop ArchStudio.</p>

<h1>Running ArchStudio after a Build from Source</h1>

<p>Once the build is done in Eclipse, you can run the built version of
   ArchStudio by launching it as an Eclipse application.  This will start
   a second copy of Eclipse, which will include the ArchStudio plugins.
   We have also included an Eclipse launch script in the ArchStudio
   directory, under <code>res/eclipse</code>.</p>

<h1>Common Problem</h1>

<p>Some people have reported some errors/problems in the Package Explorer
   when setting up the archstudio4 project. Often this is because not all
   the dependent Packages are in the Workspace. Sometimes the problem
   persists even though all packages are in place.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Package Explorer shows errors to archstudio4,
   even though all the supporting packages are in the Workspace.
   One of the most common reasons that the project is marked with errors is due to
   the a mismatch in what the project needs from Java and what Eclipse is providing
   to the project. Often this occurs because:</p>

<ol>
   <li>The project's Java compile settings are to an older version not supported in
       the current project's release.</li>
   <li>The project's Java classpaths have not been updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Solution 1: Verify/Adjust Java Compile Settings</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the archstudio4 project in the Package Explorer Pane. Right-click and select 'Properties'
      to view the Properties Pane.</li>
  <li>In the Properties Pane, click on the 'Java Compile' to view the version of Java being used.</li>
  <li>Currently Java 1.5 is being supported by ArchStudio4, so be sure the Java Compiler is set to 5.0.</li>
</ol>


<p>Solution 2: Rebuild the Classpath for the Project</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the archstudio4 project in the Package Explorer Pane.
      Right-click and select 'PDE Tools'. Select 'Update Classpath ...'</li>
  <li>In the Java Classpath Pane, click on the 'Select All' to update all classpaths
      for all plugins. Click 'Finish' to apply your update.</li>
</ol>
