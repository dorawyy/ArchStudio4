<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document describes how to check out the ArchStudio 4 (and constituent)
   code from the ISR Subversion repository and build ArchStudio from source.</p>

<p>Casual ArchStudio users or those evaluating the technology should probably
   just <a href="setup-easy.html">download and install the latest pre-built release</a>.
   However, ArchStudio developers - those who are interested in developing
   new ArchStudio components, making changes to ArchStudio itself, or those
   interested in having bleeding-edge updates to ArchStudio before they go into
   official release - should check out the ArchStudio source code and build
   the environment from source.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Source Code Environment</h1>

<p>ArchStudio and related projects are stored and managed in a
   <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository.  Subversion
   is an open-source configuration management system that is a superior replacement
   for the popular but aging CVS system.  Subversion is increasingly supported
   by tools on many popular platforms that make it easy to work with and contribute to
   our source code in your favorite development environment.</p>

<p>ArchStudio is built in and for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
   development environment.  Although you can check out ArchStudio source code
   without using Eclipse, we recommend doing it in Eclipse so you can actually
   build the source.</p>

<p>If you are just interested in browsing the source without checking it out,
   you can <a href="http://svn.ics.uci.edu/isr/projects/">browse the raw source
   archive</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>What You'll Need</h1>

<p>You will need the following installed on your machine:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>(Required)</b> A Java 2 SE, version 5.0 Software Development Kit;</li>
  <li><b>(Required)</b> Eclipse 4.2 or better <b>(Classic version)</b>;</li>
  <li><b>(Required)</b> ArchStudio itself; and</li>
  <li><b>(Highly Recommended)</b> The Subclipse Subversion client plug-in for Eclipse.</li>
  <li><b>(Optional)</b> Other Subversion clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Java 2 Software Development Kit</h2>

<p>At the current time, ArchStudio is developed on Java 2 Standard
   Edition, version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0).  You can download the runtime environment
   or development toolkit from:</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a></p>

<h2>Eclipse 4.2 or Better</h2>

<p>You will also need to download Eclipse 4.2 or better, and install it
   on your machine. Downloads and installation instructions
   are available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org/</a>.
   If you already have Eclipse, you can also download and extract a second
   copy in a separate directory solely for ArchStudio if you so desire.</p>

<h2>ArchStudio Itself</h2>

<p>You will also need to install ArchStudio itself in order to build ArchStudio. Follow the <a href="setup-easy.html"/>instructions to install ArchStudio</a> and install it
   into your Eclipse environment.

<h2>A Subversion Client</h2>

<p>A Subversion client is required to check out the source code.  Multiple
   Subversion clients can be installed concurrently and (in general) used
   interchangeably.</p>

<p>After you have downloaded Eclipse, we
   strongly recommend that you download and install the Subclipse plugin from:</p>

<p><a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">http://subclipse.tigris.org/</a></p>

<p>Subclipse will allow you to check out the ArchStudio source code directly
   into your Eclipse workspace as a set of projects.</p>

<p>You can also download additional Subversion clients for your machine,
   but only one (preferably Subclipse) is required to check out and build
   ArchStudio.</p>

<p>The primary non-Eclipse Subversion client is a command-line client,
   available as a binary download for a large number of platforms from:</p>

<p><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</a></p>

<p>GUI clients provide Subversion client functionality with a friendlier
   interface.  Some GUI clients require the Subversion command-line client to be installed
   while others do not.  You can obtain some GUI clients from:</p>

<p>TortoiseSVN: <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a>
<br/>RapidSVN: <a href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/">http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/</a></p>

<p>Instructions as to how to check out ArchStudio and related projects
   with these various clients are provided below.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Subversion Repository Organization</h1>

<p>All ISR projects use the de-facto standard
trunk/tags/branches Subversion repository configuration described
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch05s04.html">here</a>.
Our repository is located at:</p>

<pre>http://svn.ics.uci.edu/isr-projects/</pre> for read-only access, and
<pre>http://svn.ics.uci.edu/isr/projects/</pre> for commit access

<p>Current development is committed to individual project trunks.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Checking Out for the First Time</h1>

<p>Once you have the tools above installed and running, you can check out
   the ArchStudio source code.  ArchStudio is composed of a number of
   different sub-projects, each of which contributes a part to the environment.</p>

<p>Enumerating and checking out the projects one-by-one would be somewhat
   difficult, and the set of projects does change from time to time.
   To ease the process, we have created Eclipse
   <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-cvs-project-set.htm">team project set</a>
   files for ArchStudio 4.  This lets you checkout all ArchStudio 4-related
   projects into your workspace at once.  Note that you must have
   Subclipse installed for this to work.</p>

<p>First, download one or both of our Team Project Set files (only the
   first is required; the other contains feature and update-site projects
   that are used to create deployment builds of ArchStudio).  Save to
   some directory, such as your desktop.</p>

   <ul>
     <li><a href="http://svn.ics.uci.edu/isr-projects/archstudio4/trunk/edu.uci.isr.archstudio4/res/eclipse/archstudio-project-set.psf">ArchStudio 4 Project Set File</a></li>
   </ul>

<p>The remaining steps are shown here, annotated with screenshots:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="images/checkout/01-file-import.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/checkout/thumbnails/01-file-import.png" alt="Checkout Screenshot"/></a></td>
    <td>
      From Eclipse, select File &gt; Import.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="images/checkout/02-import-dialog.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/checkout/thumbnails/02-import-dialog.png" alt="Checkout Screenshot"/></a></td>
    <td>
      This brings up the File Import dialog.  Select 'Team Project Set' from the 'Team' folder.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="images/checkout/03-project-set-selection.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/checkout/thumbnails/03-project-set-selection.png" alt="Checkout Screenshot"/></a></td>
    <td>
      Select the team project set file you downloaded.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="images/checkout/04-with-working-set.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/checkout/thumbnails/04-with-working-set.png" alt="Checkout Screenshot"/></a></td>
    <td>
      Optionally, assign an Eclipse Working Set name to the set, such as 'ArchStudio 4,' to help group the projects in your Eclipse workspace.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Once this is done, click 'Finish' and Eclipse will check out all the
   ArchStudio-related projects from the Subversion repository.  It should
   build them automatically.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Running ArchStudio after a Build from Source</h1>

<p>Once the build is done in Eclipse, you can run the built version of
   ArchStudio by launching it as an Eclipse application.  This will start
   a second copy of Eclipse, which will include the ArchStudio plugins.
   We have also included an Eclipse launch script in the ArchStudio
   directory, under <code>res/eclipse</code>.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Common Problem</h1>

<p>Some people have reported some errors/problems in the Package Explorer
   when setting up the archstudio4 project. Often this is because not all
   the dependent Packages are in the Workspace. Sometimes the problem
   persists even though all packages are in place.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Package Explorer shows errors to archstudio4,
   even though all the supporting packages are in the Workspace.
   One of the most common reasons that the project is marked with errors is due to
   the a mismatch in what the project needs from Java and what Eclipse is providing
   to the project. Often this occurs because:</p>

<ol>
   <li>The project's Java compile settings are to an older version not supported in
       the current project's release.</li>
   <li>The project's Java classpaths have not been updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Solution 1: Verify/Adjust Java Compile Settings</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the archstudio4 project in the Package Explorer Pane. Right-click and select 'Properties'
      to view the Properties Pane.</li>
  <li>In the Properties Pane, click on the 'Java Compile' to view the version of Java being used.</li>
  <li>Currently Java 1.5 is being supported by ArchStudio4, so be sure the Java Compiler is set to 5.0.</li>
</ol>


<p>Solution 2: Rebuild the Classpath for the Project</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the archstudio4 project in the Package Explorer Pane.
      Right-click and select 'PDE Tools'. Select 'Update Classpath ...'</li>
  <li>In the Java Classpath Pane, click on the 'Select All' to update all classpaths
      for all plugins. Click 'Finish' to apply your update.</li>
</ol>
