<h1>Introduction to ArchStudio</h1>

<p>ArchStudio is a software and systems architecture development environment.</p>

<!--#set var="videoname" value="intro" -->
<!--#set var="videodescription" value="an introduction to ArchStudio 4" -->
<!--#include virtual="_vidlink.html" -->

<p>While most development environments, like
   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>
   and
   <a href="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/">Borland JBuilder</a>
   are code-driven development environments, ArchStudio focuses on software
   development from the perspective of
   <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/">software and systems architecture</a>.</p>

<p>We define architecture as <i>the set of principal design decisions
   about a system.</i>  This is an intentionally broad definition.
   Every project in every domain will have different needs and quality
   goals.  This means that every project will have a somewhat different
   set of design decisions that are considered <i>principal</i> by its
   stakeholders.</p>

<p>The ArchStudio environment plays two roles in the development of
   architectures:</p>

<p>First, ArchStudio is an <b>architecture development environment</b>.
   That is, the ArchStudio developers have identified recurring
   principal design concerns that occur in many domains and projects,
   and attempted to support these. ArchStudio
   has built-in support for modeling the hierarchical structure of complex
   systems, the types of various components, connectors, and interfaces,
   product-lines of systems that are related by a common base,
   and so on.</p>

<p>Second, ArchStudio is an <b>architecture meta-modeling environment</b>.
   ArchStudio is based on the highly-extensible
   <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">xADL 2.0</a>
   architecture description language.  xADL allows stakeholders
   to define and re-define the language's syntax and semantics to suit
   their own needs, and ArchStudio provides the tool support for
   this extensibility. If current modeling tools and notations are not
   sufficient to capture a particular concern for a particular project,
   ArchStudio and xADL can be extended to effectively provide support
   for that concern without having to "re-invent the wheel."  As such,
   ArchStudio provides an ideal platform for domain experts and
   architecture researchers who want to investigate new ways
   of modeling architectural concepts without investing an
   inordinate amount of time in infrastructure development.</p>

<h1>ArchStudio Capabilities</h1>

<p><b>Architecture Modeling:</b> ArchStudio creates and manipulates
   architecture descriptions expressed in the
   <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">xADL 2.0</a>
   architecture description language (ADL).  xADL is the first
   <i>modularly-extensible</i> architecture description language.
   Rather than having its syntax and semantics defined monolithically,
   in one huge chunk, xADL breaks up modeling features into modules
   using standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML schemas</a>.
   ArchStudio's integrated set of tools operates on xADL documents
   much the same way as a word processor operates on text documents.
   One major difference, however, is that ArchStudio tools integrate
   "live"&mdash;meaning that a change in any tool is reflected
   in all others immediately.  As noted above, the xADL language
   can be extended by end-users through the addition of new XML
   schemas to support domain- or project-specific concerns and
   modeling needs.  New modules are even added to the core xADL
   language from time to time as they are developed and contributed.</p>

   <b>Architecture Visualization:</b> The xADL language defines the
   structure of architecture description data, but it can be depicted
   and manipulated in many ways.  ArchStudio provides several different
   visualizations for xADL 2.0 models. Archipelago, ArchStudio's
   graphical editor, provides visualizations as symbol graphs -
   the kind of box-and-arrow models common in tools
   like Microsoft Visio and OmniGraffle.  However, unlike PowerPoint
   or OmniGraffle models, the graphical depictions in Archipelago aren't
   just pictures - they are a user-editable graphical projection of
   the underlying architecture model.  ArchStudio includes other editors
   as well, including ArchEdit, a syntax-directed editors that adapts
   to new xADL schemas automatically with no recoding, and the Type
   Wrangler, which provides a custom view of an architectural model
   that makes it easier to achieve type consistency.</p>

   <b>Architecture Analysis:</b> ArchStudio supports exploratory design
   in all its editors - architectures are rarely perfect until the latest
   stages of development. However, it is useful to be able to assess the
   correctness and consistency of an architecture description.  The Archlight
   framework provides a way to automatically test architecture descriptions
   against many different criteria.  Errors can be displayed and inspected,
   and users can navigate to the site of a problem in any editor with a few
   mouse clicks.  In keeping with ArchStudio's extensible nature, all tests
   are provided by Archlight plug-ins, and users can add their own tests
   (and even entirely new analysis engines) through Archlight's plug-in API.
   Archlight ships with the powerful
   <a href="http://www.schematron.com/">Schematron</a> XML constraint
   engine, adapted to integrate seamlessly into the Archlight user interface.
   Schematron allows complex architectural tests to be specified in
   about a dozen lines of code.</p>


<h1>ArchStudio Development Philosophy</h1>

<p>A critical aspect of ArchStudio's ongoing development is that we
   <i>use ArchStudio to develop ArchStudio</i> - we adopt our own
   architecture-centric development approach in its development.
   ArchStudio's architecture is specified in a xADL 2.0 file,
   and this xADL file is part of the ArchStudio implementation.
   Whenever ArchStudio starts up on a machine, its architecture
   description is being parsed, and the information in that
   description is used to instantiate and connect the components
   and connectors in the architecture.</p>

<h1>ArchStudio Development</h1>

<p>ArchStudio is implemented in Java 2&trade; Standard Edition
   (J2SE) version 5.0, also known as Java 1.5.  It is implemented
   as a set of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> plug-ins.
   It should run on any platform that supports Eclipse, including
   Windows 2000 or better, MacOS X, and Linux/UNIX.</p>

<p>Although ArchStudio is a research project, its developers have
   undertaken extensive efforts to mature and productize it.  Its
   previous release, ArchStudio 3, was a standalone Java application,
   and sustained more than 70 releases over five years.  The mature
   ArchStudio 3 codebase is at the core of ArchStudio 4, but
   ArchStudio 4 includes a number of exciting new features, including
   significant user-interface and performance enhancements.</p>

<h1>Where to Now?</h1>

<p>ArchStudio is an open-source project and is free to download and
   use.  We encourage you to <a href="setup-easy.html">download and install</a>
   ArchStudio and experiment with it.  Queries and support requests
   are always appreciated on our <a href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>
