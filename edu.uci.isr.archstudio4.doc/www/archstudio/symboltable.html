<h1>Symbol Table</h1>

<p>The SymbolTable included as part of the BooleanEval package provides a very basic mapping from
   variable to their values.  It is implemented with a java hashtable.  For complete information,
   please see the java documentation for SymbolTable.  The 2 main functions that will be needed is
   put and get.</p>

<h2>Put</h2>

<p>Put simply takes in 2 strings. The first string is the name of the
   variable. The second string is the string representation of the
   variable's value. For more information about the string representation,
   <a href="stringformat.html">go here</a>. Note that there is a type
   associated with the value.&nbsp; The function does not return anything and will
   throw an exception of the string passed in for value could not be parsed.</p>

<p>Example call:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
// this will store the variable a with the string containing hello
symTable.put( "a", "\"hello\"" );
</pre>

<h2>Get</h2>

<p>Get simply returns the value associated with the variable.  It takes in a
   single string representing the name of the variable and it returns the
   value associated with the variable.  It does not throw any exceptions; it
   however will return null if the variable could not be found.</p>

<p>Example call:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
// this will retrieve the value associated with the variable a.
// note that the value is an Object and it could be one of 3 classes:
// Date, Double, or String.

// A simple check with instanceof will determine the actual type.
Object value = symTable.get( "a" );
</pre>
