<h1>ArchStudio and Myx</h1>

<p>ArchStudio 4 is built in an architectural style called Myx.
   The Myx style, and how it is used to build plug-ins like ArchStudio,
   is described here.  This document supersedes earlier versions of
   the style description, such as the Myx whitepaper</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Myx Architectural Style</h1>

<p>We define an architectural style as follows:</p>

<p style="padding: 10px">An <b>architectural style</b> is a set of
   constraints put on development to elicit beneficial properties.</p>

<p>That is, an architectural style provides a set of rules, or
   constraints, that limit how the application may be built, how its
   components and connectors may communicate, and so on.  While these
   constraints reduce the freedom of system implementers, they also
   help implementers to build systems with well-known properties. To
   use an analogy from building architecture, buildings constructed
   in the Swiss Chalet style are constrained to have steep roofs.
   This constraint elicits a particular beneficial property: snow
   will slide off the roof, rather than building up crushing the structure.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Myx style is a set of rules for composing the
   components and connectors of an application like ArchStudio.
   It provides patterns of composition for synchronous and asynchronous
   interactions among components.  It also provides rules for what kinds
   of assumptions components may make about each other, ensuring
   a directed/layered ordering of dependencies among components.</p>

<p>By adhering to these constraints, Myx applications (including
   ArchStudio) recieve certain benefits.  Components remain relatively
   independent from one another, and it is easy to reuse components.
   Components only communicate through explicit interfaces, so it is
   easy to rewire components in different configurations
   without recoding the components themselves. Explicit mechanisms
   are present to permit architectural dynamism&mdash;the ability to change
   the architectural structure at runtime&mdash;in specific places where
   the architect chooses.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Constraints of the Myx Style</h1>

<p>There are five key architectural elements in a Myx architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Components</b> are the loci of computation. They can add new
      capabilities or functions to an application.  They can transform
      data in semantically-meaningful ways. They provide services to
      other components.</li>
  <li><b>Connectors</b> are the loci of communication. Connectors
      generally support the movement of data and control between
      bricks. They may change the form of data, but do not generally
      change its meaning. In Myx, connectors also drive much of the
      architectural concurrency, as detailed below.</li>
  <li><i>NB: Collectively, components and connectors are called
      &quot;bricks&quot;.</i></li>
  <li><b>Interfaces</b> are the &quot;portals&quot; through which
      bricks interact with the outside world. In Myx, all interfaces
      are defined as either <i>provided</i> or <i>required</i>. These
      terms are explained below. An interface is associated with a
      single brick, and may be considered part of that brick.</li>
  <li><b>Links</b> are the associations between provided and required
      interfaces.  Links do not add new services to the
      architecture: if new semantics are needed between two interfaces,
      a connector or component should be interposed. Links are inherently
      non-directional; the direction of control and data flow along the
      link is established by the interface endpoints.</li>
  <li><b>Interface Mappings</b> are similar to links, but are used
      differently. Interface mappings are used in hierarchical architectures
      (where bricks contain inner architectures) to associate an interface
      on an outer brick with an interface on an inner brick.  Like links,
      they do not add new services to the architecture; they merely indicate
      that the outer and inner interfaces should be treated as the same
      interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default form for an interface in Myx is a set of one or more
   functions (also known as methods or procedures) that can be called.
   However, different implementations of Myx systems may use different
   forms of interfaces.</p>

<p>Every interface is designated as either a provided or a required interface.
   A provided interface is used as the interface to a service provided by
   its brick. Provided interfaces are the interfaces that are invoked by
   other bricks.  Required interfaces are used to invoke services provided
   by other bricks.</p>

<p>All communication among Myx bricks must occur through interfaces. Other
   forms of communication (direct manipulation through pointers or references,
   communication through the filesystem, and so on) are prohibited.</p>

<p>To satisfy this constraint and to promote loose coupling, all interfaces
   on Myx bricks must be <i>remotable</i>. This means that all data passed
   across the interface&mdash;parameter values, return values, and
   exceptions&mdash;must be serializable. Once data has passed across a brick
   boundary, it may not be manipulated by other bricks through the use of
   latent pointers or references.  If objects are passed across brick
   boundaries, only the brick that last received the object may invoke its
   methods.  Effectively, this constraint means that components must operate
   as if they occupy separate memory spaces.</p>

<p>Links have exactly two endpoints. Each link connects exactly one required
   interface to one provided interface.</p>

<p>A provided interface may have zero or more links to required interfaces.
   A required interface may have zero or more links to provided interfaces.</p>

<p>All bricks have two &quot;domains&quot; called <b>top</b> and <b>bottom</b>.
   All interfaces on a brick must be assigned to one of these domains. Both
   provided and required interfaces can be on the brick's top or bottom
   domain.  Links are used to connect an interface on one brick's top domain
   to an interface on another brick's bottom domain. This is intended to induce
   layering in Myx architectures.</p>

<p>If a brick <i>B2</i> is connected to an interface on the bottom domain of a
   brick <i>B1</i>, then <i>B2</i> is <b>below</b> <i>B1</i>.  Conversely, if a brick
   <i>B2</i> is connected to an interface on the top domain of <i>B1</i>,
   then <i>B2</i> is <b>above</b> <i>B1</i>. 'Above' and 'below' relationships
   are transitive: if <i>B1</i> is above <i>B2</i>, and <i>B2</i> is above
   <i>B3</i>, then <i>B1</i> is above <i>B3</i>, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Cycles are not permitted.  That is, a brick may never be above or below
   itself. A link may not connect a brick to itself.</p>

<p>A brick may make assumptions about services provided by other bricks
   above it, but may not make assumptions about services provided by other
   bricks below it. That is, a brick may fail if adequate services
   are not provided above it, but a brick must not fail if no services
   are provided below it. If a brick requires a service provided above it,
   but that service is not available or not connected, bricks should make
   an effort to degrade gracefully.  This is known as the
   <i>substrate independence</i> constraint.</p>

<p>Synchronous invocations between components are permitted upward only.
   In a synchronous invocation, the invoking brick waits for the invocation
   to complete before continuing. In general, this is achieved through the
   use of an ordinary function call.</p>

<p>Asynchronous invocations are permitted both upward and downward.  In an
   asynchronous invocation, the invoking brick continues processing after
   initiating the invocation, which proceeds concurrently in a separate thread
   of control. In general, this is implemented through the use of an intermediate
   event-pump connector or equivalent.  The restriction that all downward
   component-to-component invocations be asynchronous promotes
   loose coupling between layers, such that the substrate independence
   constraint is honored.  Additionally, it helps to prevent deadlocks.</p>

<p>Applications have at least one main thread of control. Individual bricks can
   create and maintain new threads as necessary.  In general, asynchronous
   connectors such as event pumps create at least one new thread of control.</p>

<p>The Myx style is designed to support selective dynamism. That is, the architect
   is permitted to determine when and whether a component may be dynamically added to
   or removed from the architecture, and when and whether a link may be dynamically
   added or removed from the architecture. In general, a brick may be implemented
   so it supports dynamic addition and removal and/or dynamic linking and unlinking on
   its interfaces.  If two connected bricks are implemented as non-dynamic, but dynamism
   is needed between them, dynamic proxy connectors can be constructed to add
   some dynamism support.</p>

<h1>Benefits of the Myx Style</h1>

<p>As noted above, architectural styles are constructed to elicit particular
   benefits in systems constructed according to the style.  Some of the benefits
   of using Myx are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Performance:</b> In many implementations, Myx invocations can be implemented
      as unmediated synchronous procedure calls. Architectural frameworks and
      infrastructure, then, generally do not participate in the ordinary operation
      of a Myx system, and thus building a system in the Myx style adds no runtime
      computational overhead to the system execution.</li>
  <li><b>Reusability:</b> Because components and connectors are constrained
      to communicate only through well-defined interfaces, they can be easily
      separated.  All dependencies are explicit, and in general code for any given
      component or connector should compile independently. This means that components
      and connectors can be reused in different contexts, and composed in ways
      that were not originally anticipated.</li>
  <li><b>Flexibility:</b> The Myx constraints, particularly the substrate
      independence constraint, induce strict layering among the components and
      connectors in a system.  A Myx architecture can be horizontally &quot;sliced&quot;
      at any point, throwing away the layers at the bottom of the architecture.  All
      dependencies in the remaining components should be satisfied, and that
      architectural "core" will remain functional.</li>
  <li><b>Dynamism:</b> The use of selective dynamism techniques and dynamism-aware
      connectors gives the architect fine-grained control over runtime dynamism.</li>
  <li><b>Concurrency:</b> The Myx requirement to use true asynchronous notifications
      for downward communication, and its explicit support for true asynchronous
      requests promotes better use of multiprocessor and multicore systems.</li>
  <li><b>Reduced Deadlock Risk:</b> Because bricks operate as if they are in separate
      memory spaces and do not directly share resources, and because all synchronous
      invocations go in one direction (upward) in the architecture, it is harder for two
      threads to inadvertently lock the same set of resources in different orders, causing
      potential deadlocks.</li>
  <li><b>Distributability:</b> Because bricks act as if they are effectively running in
      separate memory spaces, it is generally very easy to split an application across
      process or machine boundaries, where bricks are actually physically separated into
      separate memory spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Common Patterns in the Myx Style</h1>

<p>The constraints above induce several common patterns in Myx architectures.
   We attempt to document some of them here to assist architects in composing
   applications.</p>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/myx/concepts.png" alt="Concepts"/></p>

<p>Here, we will use a graphical notation to depict the composition patterns.
   The above shows the elements used.  Both a component (double-bordered box)
   and connector (single-bordered box) are shown; these are also displayed
   in different colors for more distinction.  Both top and bottom provided
   and required interfaces are labeled. The domain of an interface is indicated
   by its placement on the box (top or bottom edge).  Provided interfaces are
   depicted with a triangle pointing inward toward the brick, and required
   interfaces are depicted with a triangle pointing outward.</p>

<h2>The Synchronous Call Pattern</h2>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/myx/synccall.png" alt="Synchronous Call Pattern"/></p>

<p>This is a basic upward synchronous procedure call. Here, a required interface
   on the calling component is connected directly to a provided interface on the
   called component. In general, these calls are implemented as ordinary procedure
   calls: the calling component passes its thread of control to the called
   component during invocation, the called component completes its invocation and
   returns control to the calling component. Data is passed from the calling to the
   called component (in the form of call parameters) and returned from the called
   to the calling component (in the form of return values or exceptions).</p>

<h2>The Synchronous Call with Proxy Pattern</h2>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/myx/synccallproxy.png" alt="Synchronous Call With Proxy Pattern"/></p>

<p>This is also a synchronous upward call, but with a proxy interposed. In general,
   proxies add some semantics to the interconnection or the invocations between
   bricks.  For example, perhaps the calling and called components are implemented
   such that dynamic linking to their interfaces is not permitted. If the proxy connector
   is implemented in such a way that dynamic linking to its interfaces IS permitted,
   then the link between the calling and called components can be made dyamic through
   the use of this pattern.  The intermediate proxy may also perform services such as
   data format transformation, logging, debugging, and so on.</p>

<h2>The Asynchronous Notification Pattern</h2>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/myx/asyncnotification.png" alt="Asynchronous Notification Pattern"/></p>

<p>This is the most common downward notification pattern seen in Myx architectures.
   Here, the notifying component emits notifications to the notified components,
   perhaps of an internal state change or externally sensed event.  As per the Myx
   rules, because these notifications are in the downward direction between components,
   they must be asynchronous.  This is achieved through the interposition of an event
   pump connector.  An event pump connector has simple semantics: it receives a message
   on its provided interface and, in a separate thread, forwards that message to all
   bricks connected to its required interrface.</p>

<p>Note that the downward calls between the components and connectors are likely
   implemented as synchronous procedure calls: this does not violate the Myx style
   rules because these are component-to-connector connections. The component-to-component
   notification semantics are still asynchronous, with the asynchrony provided by the
   interposed event pump.</p>

<h2>The Asynchronous Request Pattern</h2>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/myx/asyncrequest.png" alt="Asynchronous Request Pattern"/></p>

<p>This pattern mirrors the asynchronous notification pattern. Here, the event pump
   performs the same function, but the asynchronous notifications are traveling upward
   rather than downward. After the event pump receives the request from either requester,
   control is returned immediately to the requester.  Then, the request is forwarded to
   the requested component in a separate thread of control by the event pump.</p>

<h2>The Multiway Call Pattern</h2>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/myx/multiway.png" alt="Multiway Call Pattern"/></p>

<p>This is an example of a more advanced composition pattern in Myx.  Here, the three
   called components (1, 2, and 3) all expose the same kind of provided interface.  The
   calling component wants to invoke the same operation on all three components
   simultaneously. This is accomplished through the use of a multiway call connector.
   The calling component invokes the operation once, on the single multiway connector.
   The connector then invokes the corresponding operation on all three called components.
   This may happen serially, in a single thread, or in parallel, in multiple threads.
   What happens next depends on the implementation of the multiway connector:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Synchronous Multiway Call:</b> Here, the calling component is blocked until
      all the called components complete. The aggregate set of results, if any, is
      then returned to the calling component. Note that this is easier in some programming
      languages than others. For example, consider a strongly-typed language in which the
      invoked function returns a single integer.  The multiway connector will have three
      integers to return, one from each called component.  The multiway connector cannot
      then return an array of integers.  If this is the case, it is useful to return a
      default value (perhaps '0') and then provide an integer array of all reults from
      a separate 'results' interface on the multiway connector, as shown in the diagram
      above. In a dynamically typed language, the multiway connector could return
      an array or collection of integers instead.</li>
  <li><b>Asynchronous Multiway Call:</b> Here, control is returned to the calling
      component immediately.  If the invoked function has a return value, a default
      value (perhaps 0 or <code>null</code> is returned).  Later, the calling component
      can call the separate 'results' interface to receive results.  The results interface
      may expose functions that query whether results are ready yet, return partial results,
      etc.</li>
  <li><b>Asynchronous Multiway Call with Asynchronous Notification:</b> Here, control is
      returned to the calling component immediately, just as in the above scenario.  However,
      an (additional) asynchronous downward link is created from the mulitway connector to
      the calling component. This is used for one of two purposes: 1) to notify the calling
      component that results are now available, or 2) to asynchronously provide the calling
      component with the results, either all at once or as they arrive.  In this case, the
      upward 'results' link in the above diagram would either be replaced by or augmented
      with a downward link.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>The myx.fw Framework</h2>

<p>Building applications in the Myx style requires adhering to the constraints
   of the style.  This can be difficult in a language like Java
   that does not necessarily have implementation support for all
   Myx concepts.  To bridge this gap, we have implemented an
   architecture framework called myx.fw that can be used to implement
   Myx applications in Java.  It is currently distributed as an
   integrated part of ArchStudio, but is also available as a separate
   package.</p>

<p>TBD</p>
