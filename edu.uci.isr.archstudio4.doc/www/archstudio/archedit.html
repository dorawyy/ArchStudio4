<h1>ArchEdit: A Syntax-Directed Editor for xADL Documents</h1>

<p>ArchEdit is a graphical, syntax-directed editor for xADL
   2.0 documents.  It uses a tree-based graphical user interface
   similar to many XML editors or Microsoft's Regedit.  Like
   Regedit, it is a low-level tool for editing architecture documents.
   It does not enforce semantic constraints on architecture
   descriptions, and is primarily useful for low-level inspection
   and editing of such descriptions.  The advantage
   of this tool is that it automatically adapts itself to new xADL
   schemas when the language is extended.  So, new or enhanced builds
   of ArchStudio do not require ArchEdit to be changed.</p>

<p>An ArchEdit screenshot is shown here:</p>

<p>Architects can navigate the architecture description by expanding
   and collapsing nodes in the tree view in the left panel.  As nodes
   are selected, editable attributes and elements containing
   architecture data appear in the right panel.  If a node is an XLink
   (a link between two disconnected nodes in the XML document), drag and
   drop support is provided to edit the link efficiently.</p>

<h1>Using ArchEdit</h1>

<p>ArchEdit can be invoked from the ArchStudio launcher
   view, or by right-clicking on any xADL document in the
   Eclipse Navigator and selecting Open With &gt; ArchEdit.</p>

<p>The ArchEdit interface is most analogous to the
   Windows Registry Editor interface.  The left pane
   shows the document in a tree-format.  Elements
   with children (or the potential for children)
   are depicted as folders with an "expand" control
   next to them.  Elements without the potential
   for children have document icons.  For convenience,
   if an element has an identifier (ID), the identifier
   will appear in parentheses after the element name.</p>

<p>When you click on an element, any attributes of
   the element will appear in the right pane, ready for
   editing.  If the element is an XLink, an additional
   section will appear in the right pane, with a link
   area:</p>

<p><a href="images/archedit/03-archedit-link.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archedit/thumbnails/03-archedit-link.png" alt="ArchEdit Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>To quickly make a link from the selected element to
   another element, click-and-drag the link area in the
   right pane and drop it on the target element in the
   tree on the left.  Note that for this to succeed,
   the link target must be an element that has an ID.
   This drag-and-drop operation is just a shortcut
   for filling out the two fields (type and href) in
   the XLink panel, of course.</p>

<p>Creating new elements requires clicking an element
   with the secondary button on your mouse.  This is
   commonly referred to as right-clicking.  Macintosh
   users may have to Option-click the element to get
   the appropriate result.  Right clicking an element
   will bring up a context menu.</p>

<p>The first menu is the "Remove" option,
   which allows you to remove an element (and all its
   children) from its parent.</p>

<p>If the element's type has subtypes defined
   in the data binding library in use, then those will
   appear as options for "promotions," as shown in the
   second section of the menu.  Promoting an element
   from its current type to one of its subtypes usually
   allows it to have more sub-elements and attributes.
   The subtypes that are available are defined in the
   XML schemas used to create the data binding library.</p>

<p>The third section of the menu allows you to add
   sub-elements to the selected element.  For sub-elements
   with cardinality at-most-one, you will be prohibited from
   adding more than one sub-element, and the option will
   appear gray when one has been added, as is seen above.
   Available new sub-elements appear as selectable
   menu options.  Sub elements appear as children
   of the given element in the tree.</p>

<p>ArchEdit also responds to all events emitted by
   xArchADT.  Thus, changes to an architecture induced by
   any other tool in ArchStudio will be reflected
   in xArchADT automatically.</p>
