<h1>Pruning</h1>

<p>The ArchStudio Pruner component can be used to remove all structures
   (architecture structures), types, and version graphs that are not part of a
   selected architecture found in a xADL document.
   The algorithm used in the Pruner component traverses
   through the architectural elements hierarchicaly and
   discovers which elements are not linked up to architecture and need to be
   &quot;pruned.&quot; The algorithm achieves this by taking a starting
   element, either a type or structure, and then  hierarchically visiting
   each of the structures' architectural elements (components, connectors, and
   interfaces) and inspecting those elements' corresponding types as well as
   visiting the substructure (if any) of all component types and connector types. Any elements not
   visited in this fashion are removed from the document. Ultimately, this
   results in an architecture that consists only of architectural elements that can
   be reached by traveling hierarchically down the architecture from the specified starting
   element.</p>

<p>Additionally, the pruner removes any version graph whose
   internal nodes are not referenced by any type included in the selected
   architecture. The entire document is cloned before pruning so that the pruning
   is performed on a copy of the document. For more information on xADL documents,
   visit the <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">xADL 2.0 website</a>.</p>

<p>The diagram below gives a simple illustration on what the Pruner
   component does to an architecture. The architecture on the left hand side
   includes a structure containing components A, B, and C. The architecture
   also contains the components' respective types (links to these types are shown
   with dotted arrows) as well as two extraneous types, component types D, and E.
   The resulting architecture after the pruning operation was performed (seen on
   the right) looks just like the original architecture; however, the extraneous
   types are removed. Also, supposing component type E had internal
   substructure its substructure would be removed too (not shown in diagram).

<p>This component could be used, for example, after an architecture has been processed
   through the <a href="selector.html">Selector</a>. The larger architecture will only have a subset selected
   from it and the unselected types and structures will then be removed after being run through the
   Pruner.  Please refer to the <a href="selector.html">Selector</a> documentation for instructions on how to
   use the Selector and Pruner components through a convenient GUI.</p>
