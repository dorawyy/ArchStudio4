<h1>Version Pruning</h1>

<p>The Version Pruner component can
   be used to remove all versioning information from a xADL document. The end
   result of running a xADL document through this component is a document which has
   all version graphs removed as well as any links from types to their respective
   version nodes removed. The component achieves this by simply iterating over all types
   and clearing the links to their version nodes; additionally, all version graphs
   are removed from the document. For more information on xADL documents,
   visit the <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">xADL 2.0 website</a>.</p>

<p>This component could be used, for example, along with the
   <a href="selector.html">Selector</a> and
   <a href="pruner.html">Pruner</a> components. Please refer to the
   <a href="selector.html">Selector Driver</a> component for instructions on
   how to use the Selector, Pruner, and Prune Versions components through a
   convenient GUI.</p>
