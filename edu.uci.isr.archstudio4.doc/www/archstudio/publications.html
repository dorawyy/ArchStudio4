<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   A software system's architecture can be seen as the set of principal design
   decisions about that system. These design decisions can be captured in architectural
   models. Existing approaches to architecture modeling support general concerns
   well, but are difficult or impossible to adapt to new concerns or domains. This
   research examines how to support stakeholder-driven architecture modeling:
   modeling in a world where the system's stakeholders materially participate in
   deciding what kinds of design decisions will be modeled and at what level of detail,
   as well as how they will be visualized, analyzed, and applied in other development
   activities. Contributions include a highly-extensible language (xADL) and
   environment (ArchStudio) for stakeholder-driven architecture modeling, a
   demonstration that many architectural concerns can be modularized within this
   environment, and a set of design principles that guide and inform the construction
   of the environment. Application and use of the environment in a variety of domains
   and projects demonstrates its effectiveness, and evidence indicates that the amount
   of effort needed to develop extensions to the environment scales with the
   conceptual complexity of those extensions.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   Research over the past decade has revealed that modeling
   software architecture at the level of components and connectors
   is useful in a growing variety of contexts. This has led to
   the development of a plethora of notations for representing software
   architectures, each focusing on different aspects of the systems
   being modeled. In general, these notations have been developed
   without regard to reuse or extension. This makes the effort in
   adapting an existing notation to a new purpose commensurate with
   developing a new notation from scratch. To address this problem,
   we have developed an approach that allows for the rapid construction
   of new architecture description languages (ADLs). Our approach is
   unique because it encapsulates ADL features in modules that are
   composed to form ADLs. We achieve this by leveraging the extension
   mechanisms provided by XML and XML schemas. We have defined a set
   of generic, reusable ADL modules called xADL 2.0, useful as an
   ADL by itself, but also extensible to support new applications
   and domains. To support this extensibility, we have developed
   a set of reflective syntax-based tools that adapt to language
   changes automatically, as well as several semantically-aware
   tools that provide support for advanced features of xADL 2.0.
   We demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and flexibility of
   our approach through a diverse set of experiences. First, our
   approach has been applied in industrial contexts, modeling software
   architectures for aircraft software and spacecraft systems. Second,
   we show how xADL 2.0 can be extended to support the modeling
   features found in two different representations for modeling
   product-line architectures. Finally, we show how our infrastructure
   has been used to support its own development. The technical
   contribution of our infrastructure is augmented by several research
   contributions: the first decomposition of an architecture description
   language into modules, insights about how to develop new language
   modules and a process for integrating them, and insights about the
   roles of different kinds of tools in a modular ADL-based infrastructure.</p>

<p>Applications built in a strongly decoupled, eventbased
   interaction style have many commendable characteristics,
   including ease of dynamic configuration, accommodation
   of platform heterogeneity, and ease of distribution
   over a network. It is not always easy to humanly
   grasp the dynamic behavior of such applications, since
   many threads are active and events are asynchronously
   (and profusely) transmitted. We present a set of requirements
   for an aid to assist in the human understanding and
   exploration of the behavior of such applications through
   the incremental refinement of rules for determining causality
   relationships between messages sent among components.
   A prototype tool is presented, indicating one
   viable approach to meeting these requirements. Experience
   with the tool reinforces some of the requirements
   and indicates others.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   Our approach to creating self-healing systems is based on
   software architecture, where repairs are done at the level of a
   software system's components and connectors. In our
   approach, event-based software architectures are targeted
   because they offer significant benefits for run-time
   adaptation. Before an automated planning agent can decide
   how to repair a self-healing system, a significant
   infrastructure must be in place to support making the planned
   repair. Specifically, the self-healing system must be built using
   a framework that allows for run-time adaptation, there must
   be a language in which to express the repair plan, and there
   must be a reconfiguration agent that can execute the repair
   plan once it is created. In this paper, we present tools and
   methods that implement these infrastructure elements in the
   context of an overall architecture-based vision for building
   self-healing systems. The paper concludes with a gap analysis
   of our current infrastructure vs. the overall vision, and our
   plans for fulfilling that vision.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   Research and experimentation in software architectures over the
   past decade have yielded a plethora of software architecture description
   languages (ADLs). Continuing innovation indicates that
   it is reasonable to expect more new ADLs, or at least ADL features.
   This research process is impeded by the difficulty and cost
   associated with developing new notations. An architect in need of
   a unique set of modeling features must either develop a new architecture
   description language from scratch or undertake the daunting
   task of modifying an existing language. In either case, it is
   unavoidable that a significant effort will be expended in building
   or adapting tools to support the language. To remedy this situation,
   we have developed an infrastructure for the rapid development
   of new architecture description languages. Key aspects of
   the infrastructure are its XML-based modular extension mechanism,
   its base set of reusable and customizable architectural modeling
   constructs, and its equally important set of flexible support
   tools. This paper introduces the infrastructure and demonstrates
   its value in the context of several real-world applications.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   XML's meta-language aspect and extensive tool support make it an
   attractive way to build modularly extensible modeling languages.
   XML's original meta-language, the document type definition
   (DTD), is being replaced by the more expressive XML schema.
   Developing programmatic tools to manipulate models specified in
   XML schemas is made easier though the use of data bindings. Data bindings
   model elements and attributes in XML schemas as objects
   in an object-oriented programming language. We have developed
   an XML-schema aware generator for Java data bindings called <i>'apigen'</i>.
   While developing apigen, we encountered and worked
   through several issues, both essential and accidental, related to generating
   XML schema data bindings. These issues, and the solutions
   we developed, are described in this paper.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   Software architecture research focuses on models of software
   architectures as specified in architecture description
   languages (ADLs). As research progresses in specific areas of
   software architectures, more and more architectural
   information is created. Ideally, this information can be stored
   in the model. An extensible modeling language is crucial to
   experimenting with and building tools for novel modeling
   constructs that arise from evolving research. Traditional
   ADLs typically support a small set of modeling constructs
   very well, but adapt to others poorly. XML provides an ideal
   platform upon which to develop an extensible modeling
   language for software architectures. Previous XML-based
   ADLs successfully leveraged XML's large base of off-the-shelf
   tool support, but did not take advantage of its extensibility. To
   give software architecture researchers more freedom to
   explore new possibilities and modeling techniques while
   maximizing reuse of tools and modeling constructs, we have
   developed xADL 2.0, a highly extensible XML-based ADL.
   xADL 2.0 supports run-time and design time modeling,
   architecture configuration management, and model-based
   system instantiation. Additionally, xADL 2.0 has a set of
   extensible infrastructure tools that support the creation,
   manipulation, and sharing of xADL 2.0 documents.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i><br/>
   Product family architectures need to be captured much like "regular" software architectures.
   Unfortunately, representations for product family architectures are scarce and a deep understanding
   of all of the necessary features of such representations is still lacking. In this paper,
   we introduce an extensible XML-based representation that is suitable as a basis for rapidly
   defining new representations for product family architectures. We describe some of the details
   of this representation and present how Koala and Mae, two early representations for product family
   architectures, can be mapped onto our XML-based representation with relatively little effort.</p>
