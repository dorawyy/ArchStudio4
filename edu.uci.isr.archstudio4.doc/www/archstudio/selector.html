<h1>The Selector Component</h1>

<p>The selector provides a user interface which allows a simple means of
   graphically invoking the
   <a href="selector.html">Selector</a>,
   <a href="pruner.html">Pruner</a>, and
   <a href="versionpruner.html">Version Pruner</a> components.
   To begin using it, open a xADL document in the selector using the
   <a href="launcher.html">ArchStudio Launcher</a>.</p>

<p>The selector has a simple user interface:</p>

<p><a href="images/selector/01-selector.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/selector/thumbnails/01-selector.png" alt="Selector Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>To use it, follow the following sequence of steps.</p>

<p>First, select a starting point for selection or pruning.  In a
   hierarchical architecture, this will generally be the outermost
   architectural structure or type (e.g., the one that is not contained
   in any other structure or type).  This is done by clicking on one
   of these elements in the outline view.</p>

<p>Second, if you are performing selection, use the symbol table and
   the buttons below it to add, edit, and remove variable-value bindings.
   These will be used to evaluate the various boolean guards in a
   product-line architecture.  If you are performing only pruning or
   version pruning, the symbol table has no effect.  It is also possible
   to store and load symbol sets to and from files using the
   'Import Symbols' and 'Export Symbols' buttons.</p>

<p>Third, check off the operations you want to perform (select, prune,
   or version prune).</p>

<p>Once you have completed these steps, click the "Run Selected Tasks"
   button.  This will bring up a 'save resource' dialog in which you can
   choose where to save the selected/pruned architecture in a separate
   xADL file.  Because these operations are generally destructive, it
   is not possible to apply them in-line to the open xADL file.</p>
