<h1>Archlight: An Analysis Framework for ArchStudio</h1>

<p>Archlight is a framework of components for integrating architecture
   analysis tools into ArchStudio.  It provides a unified user
   interface for users to select and run tests that
   check various properties of architecture descriptions.</p>

<p>This is a screenshot of the Archlight Graphical User Interface:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/01-archlight-screenshot.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/01-archlight-screenshot.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>The Archlight GUI is divided up into four primary areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The Outline View</b> (on the left): Displays a
    hierarchically-organized set of tests that can be run on
    the current document.  The tests that appear in the tree
    are provided by the available testing tools.  Each test
    may be in a different state of enablement, as described below.</li>
<li><b>The Editor View</b>: The main, upper-right pane displays
    information about the selected test or tests, and provides
    buttons to enable and disable these tests.</li>
<li><b>The Issues View</b>: The lower-right pane displays
    errors detected by tests that have been run.</li>
<li><b>The Notices View</b>: Contained on another tab in the
    lower-right quadrant of the screen, the Archlight Notices
    View displays informational notices generated by Archlight
    and its constituent tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Archlight Concepts</h2>

<p>Within the Archlight framework, many analysis tools coordinate
   to provide the user a unified suite of tests that can be run
   over architecture documents.  These tests are presented
   hierarchically, as a tree.  Each test has a distinguished
   place in the tree; a test's place in the tree is defined
   as part of the test itself.</p>

<p>Due to the wide variety
   of architectures, architectural styles, and stages of
   development, not all documents will be expected to pass
   all tests.  Therefore, Archlight gives the user the ability
   to apply only a subset of all tests to a given document.
   Tests can be in one of three states:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight-icon1.png" alt="Applied Test Icon"/>
   <b>Applied Test</b>: This test is applied to the document.
   This means that the user expects that the document will pass
   this test.  This test will run when all tests are run on the
   document.</p>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight-icon2.png" alt="Disabled Test Icon"/>
   <b>Disabled Test</b>: This test is applied to the document.
   This means that the user expects that the document will pass
   this test.  However, this test is temporarily disabled.
   This test will NOT run when all tests are run on the
   document, and issues that would be identified by the test will
   not be reported until the test is re-enabled.</p>

<p><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight-icon3.png" alt="Unapplied Test Icon"/>
   <b>Unapplied Test</b>: This test is not applied to the document.
   This means that the user does not expect that the document will
   pass this test. This test will NOT run when all tests are run on
   the document, and issues that would be identified by the test will
   not be reported.</p>
</div>

<p>The suite of available tests is determined by the installed tools
   and the tests that they report they can run.  Whether tests
   are applied, disabled, or unapplied is a property of each document.
   Each document stores a list of applied and disabled tests.  If
   a document is encountered that references unavailable tests, those
   tests will be inserted into the tree as Unknown Tests.  Unknown
   tests will not run (since they are not available on the system)
   but they will remain associated with the document unless they
   are unapplied.</p>

<h3>Technical Detail of Test Storage</h3>

<p>Each test has a unique identifier, called a UID.  This is simply
   a string that identifies the test.  In general, the user of Archlight will
   never see these UIDs - these are created and managed by test
   developers.  A test's UID generally will never change, even if the
   test's name, purpose, or location in the tree changes.  Each
   analysis tool is expected to perform one or more tests.  These tests
   are referred to by their UIDs.  Each document stores a list of test
   UIDs and whether they are applied or disabled.  If test UIDs are
   found in a document but no tool reports that it can perform a test
   with that UID, the tests become Unknown Tests in the Archlight GUI.</p>

<h2>Running Archlight</h2>

<p>To run Archlight, start ArchStudio, and drag and drop an
   architecture description from the navigator view to the
   Archlight icon in the <a href="launcher.html">ArchStudio Launcher</a>.
   Archlight will display tests in the
   tree on the left.  Enable an appropriate
   set of tests.  Clicking on a test node in the tree will
   give you a test options button-menu in the editor pane:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/02-archlight-testmenu.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/02-archlight-testmenu.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>By clicking on one of the options, you can change the state
   of the selected test for this document.  If the selected tree
   node is a folder, you will have the option of setting the states
   of all tests contained in the subtree contained in the selected
   folder at once.  This is useful for enabling or disabling many
   tests at one time.</p>

<p>You can also context-click (right-click) on a tree node to
   set test options or test group options:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/03-archlight-testcontextmenu.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/03-archlight-testcontextmenu.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>Once you enable some tests, you can tell Archlight to run
   tests on all documents, or run tests on a specific document.
   Use the toolbar buttons or the buttons in the editor pane to
   run tests:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/04-archlight-runtests.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/04-archlight-runtests.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>While various tools run tests, they will update their status
   in the Archlight notices view:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/05-archlight-notices.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/05-archlight-notices.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>A progress dialog will show the progress of running tests.
   Any issues detected will be displayed in the Archlight Issues
   view:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/06-archlight-issues.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/06-archlight-issues.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>Right-clicking on one of the test results and selecting 'Detail'
   will show details about that result:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/07-archlight-issuedetail.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/07-archlight-issuedetail.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>Right-clicking on one of the issues will also provide menu otpions
   to focus one of ArchStudio's editors (like ArchEdit or Archipelago)
   on an element related to the test result:</p>

<p><a href="images/archlight/08-archlight-focuseditor.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archlight/thumbnails/08-archlight-focuseditor.png" alt="Archlight Screenshot"/></a></p>

<h3>Test Errors</h3>

<p>If any of the tools were unable to run the selected tests because
   of an error, a test-error notice will appear in the Archlight Notices
   view. This does not indicate that an architecture document failed to
   pass an applied test - this indicates that a test was unable to run
   because of some problem, e.g. a configuration or programming
   error.</p>
