<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document discusses how ArchStudio can be run as a user, as well
   as how developers can create and contribute changes to ArchStudio.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Setting up as a User</h1>

<p>If you just want to install and run ArchStudio as an ordinary user,
   follow the <a href="setup-easy.html">easy setup instructions</a>.
   This will let you create a runtime environment in which you can run
   and use ArchStudio as part of an Eclipse installation.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Developing Extensions for ArchStudio</h1>

<p>There are two primary ways to develop ArchStudio extensions.  The
   first is to follow the <a href="setup-easy.html">easy setup instructions</a>,
   which will install ArchStudio and its constituent parts into Eclipse.
   You can then create a new Plug-in or Fragment project that depends on these plug-ins
   and extend ArchStudio through that code.  This is only really suitable
   for small extensions, however.</p>

<p>Developers will probably prefer the second method, as it is much easier
   and more flexible&mdash;<a href="setup-fromsource.html">checking out and building ArchStudio
   from source</a>.</p>

<p>To add new components to ArchStudio, you need to modify the
   <code>archstudio4.xml</code> file, which adds your component(s), connector(s), and
   links to the ArchStudio 4 xADL description.  This file is generated by the
   <code>Description</code> class in the ArchStudio source tree.</p>

<p>If your component is nearing completion, you can contact
   <a href="mailto:edashofy@ics.uci.edu">Eric Dashofy</a> about possible inclusion of the
   component in the next release of the ArchStudio 4 environment.</p>
