<h1>The ArchStudio Launcher</h1>

<p>The ArchStudio Launcher view provides a convenient way to
   open ArchStudio documents, invoke ArchStudio tools, and create
   new documents.  When switching to the ArchStudio perspective
   in Eclipse, the Launcher view is displayed in the bottom-right
   quadrant of the screen.</p>

<p>A Launcher screenshot is shown here:</p>

<h2>Opening a File with Drag and Drop</h2>

<p>To open a file in the launcher, drag it from the navigator
   view and drop it on the editor with which you want to open
   the file.  This will open the given file in the given editor.</p>

<h2>Opening a File by Choosing an Editor</h2>

<p>You can also open a file by clicking on an editor button in
   the Launcher.  This will bring up an Open Resource dialog,
   with which you can select a xADL file from the current
   workspace.  Selecting a file in this way has the same
   effect as using drag and drop.</p>

<h2>Creating a New File</h2>

<p>The title bar of the ArchStudio launcher contains several
   utility buttons.  The leftmost button, when clicked, brings
   up a dialog that allows you to easily create a new architecture
   description file.</p>

<h2>Other Functions</h2>

<p>The other buttons in the title bar launch the default browser
   on the system, navigating to the ArchStudio website and other
   useful sites.</p>
