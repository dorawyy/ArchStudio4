<h1>Video Tutorials</h1>

<p>This website includes a number of multimedia video tutorials
   that discuss ArchStudio and how to use it.  These tutorials
   are presented through
   <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/">Adobe Flash</a>,
   and a Flash plug-in is required to view them.  They are
   generally 1-5 minutes in length and about 3-10 megabytes in size.
   Flash will stream the video after enough of it has loaded.
   They are generally narrated, so turn your speakers up when
   watching the tutorials.</p>

<p>When watching a video, moving your mouse over the video will
   bring up a control panel with play/pause/stop/reposition controls
   at the bottom of the video.</p>

<p>Video tutorials are indicated by callout boxes on the various pages
   of the ArchStudio site.  For example, the callout box
   for the "How to Install ArchStudio 4" video tutorial looks like this:</p>

<!--#set var="videoname" value="install" -->
<!--#set var="videodescription" value="how to install ArchStudio 4" -->
<!--#include virtual="_vidlink.html" -->
