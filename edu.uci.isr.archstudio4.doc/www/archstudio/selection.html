<h1>Product-Line Selection</h1>

<p>This section describes the process and concepts behind product-line
   selection in ArchStudio. Actual product-line selections are done
   by the <a href="selector.html">product-line selector</a> tool.</p>

<p>Product line architectures (PLAs) are used to describe a family
   of closely related products.  A PLA describes a set of common
   core components as well as the variation points
   across the specific product architectures.  The variation points
   modeled by
   <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">xADL 2.0</a>
   are optional elements and variant types (in the Options and
   Variants schemas).</p>

<p>Optional elements may or may not be included in the selected product
   architecture.  An element whose type is a variant type will always be included,
   but may take on alternative forms for different product architectures.
   Optionality is specified with a boolean guard (if the guard condition is
   met&mdash;that is, the boolean expression evaluates to <i>true</i>, the
   element is included) and variants are specified by mutually exclusive boolean
   guards (the variant whose guard condition evaluates to <i>true</i> is the
   selected variant).</p>

<p>ArchStudio's <a href="selector.html">Product-Line Selector</a> is used to
    automatically select a product architecture (or a smaller PLA) from a PLA based on user-specified
   variable-value bindings.  These bindings are simply name-value pairs in a
   <a href="./symboltable.html">symbol table</a>.</p>

<p>The selection process works as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each optional element in the PLA is identified.  Variables
      in the element's boolean guard are replaced by their values
      from the symbol table, and the guard condition is evaluated.
      If the condition evaluates to <i>true</i> the element is made
      non-optional (i.e., mandatory) in the architecture.  If the
      condition evaluates to <i>false</i> the element is removed
      from the architecture.  If, after evaluation, there are still
      unbound variables in the expression, the expression is
      minimized (removing parts of the expression that can be
      fully evaluated based on bindings in the symbol table),
      and the element remains optional in the architecture.</li>
  <li>Each element of variant type in the PLA is identified.
      For each variant in the variant type, variables in the variant's
      boolean guard are replaced by their values from the symbol
      table, and the guard condition is evalauted.  If the condition
      evaluates to <i>true</i>, then the element's type is changed
      to be the associated variant.  If conditions cannot be fully
      evaluated, the guards are reduced (as with optional elements)
      and the elements remain of variant type.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an optional component before selection might look like this.
   Here is Comp2 shown with its optional field which contains the boolean guard:</p>

<pre>x @[0, 50] || y &gt; 0</pre>

<p>(Note: <code>x@[0, 50]</code> is the notation for 'in range,' i.e.
   <code>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 50</code>).</p>

<p><a href="images/pla/01-opt-before.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/pla/thumbnails/01-opt-before.png" alt="PLA Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>The xADL description of this component in
   <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/guide.html">abbreviated non-XML notation</a>
   looks like this:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
component{
  (attr) id = "comp1"

  //Description and other properties elided for
  //simplicity

  optional{
    guard{
      booleanExp{
        or{

          booleanExp1{
            inRange{
              symbol = x
              value = 0
              value = 50
            }
          }

          booleanExp2{
            greaterThan{
              symbol = y
              value = 0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  (xlink) type = "#Type_1"
}
</pre>

<p>If the guard condition is met, its optional field is removed.  So for our example
   if in the symbol table we define <code>x = 10</code> (regardless of y's value),
   after selection the optional component will look like this:</p>

<p><a href="images/pla/02-opt-after.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/pla/thumbnails/02-opt-after.png" alt="PLA Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>(Note that the dotted 'optional' border is replaced by a solid 'mandatory' border.
   That same component's xADL description (in abbreviated non-XML notation) will look like this:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
component{
  (attr) id = "Comp2"
  (xlink) type = "#Type_1"
}
</pre>

<p>The optional field has been removed; this component is now a mandatory part
   of the architecture.  However, if the guard were evaluated to false, the
   component would be removed from the architecture entirely.  If parts of the
   guard could not be evaluated, the boolean expression will be simplified as
   much as possible.</p>

<p>The selector also selects variant types. Here is a variant component type
   (Variant Type) with two variants (Component Type 1 and Component Type 2):</p>

<p><a href="images/pla/03-variant-type.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/pla/thumbnails/03-variant-type.png" alt="PLA Screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>In xADL, this would look like this:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
componentType{
  (attr) id = "variantType"

  variant{
    guard{
      booleanExp{
        equals{
          symbol = language
          value = "English"
        }
      }
    }
    (xlink) variantType = "#ComponentType1"
  }

  variant{
    guard{
      booleanExp{
        equals{
          symbol = language
          value = "Spanish"
        }
      }
    }
    (xlink) variantType = "#ComponentType2"
  }
}</pre>

<p>The first variant has the guard <code>language == "English"</code>
   and the second variant has the guard <code>language == "Spanish"</code>.
   If we perform selection based on a symbol table with
   the entry <code>language = "English"</code>, all references
   to type 'variantType' will be replaced with references
   to 'ComponentType1.'</p>

<p>Note that the algorithm will report an error if all of the guards for
   the variants (of a single variant component type) evaluate to false or
   if more than one guard evaluates to true.</p>

<p>The selector requires the <a href="./booleaneval.html">Boolean Eval</a>
   component to evaluate the boolean guards used in optional and variant elements.
   Please see the options and variants schema in
   <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarchuci/">xADL 2.0</a>
   for a list of optional and variant elements that are supported by the selector.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Symbol Table Files</h2>

<p>The Selector component can load and store symbol tables (e.g.,
   sets of variable-value bindings) in an ASCII text file.
   This section describes the formatting of that file.</p>

<p>Comments can be represented by <code>//</code> just as in C++ or Java.
   Otherwise, the basic layout of the file is as follows:</p>

<pre>Variable = value
Variable = value
etc.</pre>

<p>There can be leading and trailing spaces that will be stripped away.  The value of
the variable is represented by strings as specified <a href="./stringformat.html">here.</a> Some examples:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
/* Set the value of alarm variable to the date Jan 1st 2003 */
alarm    = #1/1/03#
/* Set the value of speed variable to the number 23.1 */
speed    = 23.1
/* Sets the value of language variable to the string 'English' */
language = &quot;English&quot;
</pre>
